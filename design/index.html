                <p><strong>To me, matreport.com showed a perfect example of Alignment.
                        The visual heirarchy of the page
                        goes directly down the center. There are white barriers on both the left
                        and right sides to center the content. All images and text are centered.
                        The logo has even designs on either side of it. This makes the whole design
                        flow very well.</strong> </p>

                <p><strong>Topratedmma is a phenomenal example of Repetition. This particular
                        part of the page is about fighters who have been on the podcast.
                        They use the same style of black and white images, the same font,
                        and the same grey boxes around the Images. All in all it is very
                        repetitive. This allows the user to not be confused.</strong> </p>

                <p><strong>I was immediately drawn to this warriorcampfitness page because of the contrast
                        on this page. The bright orange button and highlights really stand out against
                        the dark background. This eliminates any confusion about where the button is.
                        They really did an amazing job with this principle.</strong>
